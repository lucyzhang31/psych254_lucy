            Here is a shortlist of potential replication project ideas: link
            <br>
            <br>

            We understand that students may prefer to replicate a paper in their own research area or related areas. If you would like to suggest a paper for replication, please carefully consider the feasibility of replicating the experiment online (e.g. a deliverable manipulation), then consult the teaching staff.

          <h4> Mechanical Turk </h4>
            <p>
              In this class we will be running our replication projects on Amazon's Mechanical Turk (AMT/mTurk). mTurk is a platform on which <b>Workers</b> (or "Turkers") can complete Human Intelligence Tasks (<b>HITs</b>) for monetary compensation. HITs are put up by <b>Requesters</b>. mTurk originally was set up to do large-scale tasks that require human intelligence (e.g. labeling photos, finding telephone numbers, etc), but has recently been used by social scientists to conduct (large-scale) online experiments.
              <br><br>
              There are many issues to consider when running studies online. Here's just a very short list.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  You will be reaching a different population (there have been several studies now on Turker demographics) that might be different from "typical" psychological studies (done with WEIRD participants -- white, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic -- see Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan, 2010).
                </li>
                <li>
                  There are constraints on what can or cannot be done -- some psychological manipulations are impossible over the web.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Design considerations. Some Turkers multitask, and most of them do HITs for many hours a day, so appropriate designs would include attention checks, manipulation checks, etc.
                </li>
              </ul>

              In this class, all replication projects will be launched using a common class account. This saves you the hassle of applying for a personal Requester account (which lately has become not-as-straightforward...), and also simplifies funding logistics. We will be giving more detailed instructions in class on how to access the class account and launch HITs etc.

            <p>

          <h4> Data analysis plan (to be made pre-data-collection) </h4>

          <h4> Ethics and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) </h4>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Note that Amazon workerIDs are actually tied to their (public) Amazon account, and thus constitute identifiable information. Thus, you should anonymize data by redacting workerIDs (and other identifiable information).
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <br>

          <h4> Best Research Practices</h4>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Once you collect the data, save the "raw" data somewhere safe, and then commit an anonymized version to version control (Git). <br>
                  Do all analyses on the anonymized data. (This is to prevent cases where others are unable to reproduce your analayses because it might rely somehow on identifiable information. If you start with anonymized data, your analyses would never use any of this information.)
                  <br><br>
                  Anonymizing means redacting the workerids (e.g. replacing them with numbers/letters) and other identifiable information (IP address, etc). A quick one liner (in R) is:
                  <br>
                        <code>d0$workerid <- match(d0$workerid, unique(sort(d0$workerid)))</code>
                  <br>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  Document all data transformations using a reproducible script, like an R script. (e.g. converting data from wide form to long form; applying exclusion criteria; etc).
                  <br>
                  You should NOT be using Excel to cut and paste to reformat your data. This is NOT reproducible, and is unacceptable for your final project; you should also learn to apply the same mindset to your own research.
                </li>
              </ul>
              
            </p>

          <h4> Making an external HIT: HTML/Javascript with mTurk </h4>
            <p>
              The <a href="http://cocolab.stanford.edu/mturk-tools.html">Computation and Cognition Lab wiki</a> has detailed instructions on how to run external HITs on mTurk. This involves a guide to downloading Amazon's Command Line Tools, writing an experiment, running your experiment, etc. That should be your first stop.

              <ol>
                <li>
                  We have a class account for running participants on mTurk.Once you have Amazon's Command Line Tools installed (see Cocolab wiki link above), you will need to modify your mturk.properties file with the access key and password (get this from the TAs). <br><br>
                  This is confidential information which <b>should NOT</b> be put on public version control (i.e. do NOT put your mturk.properties file in a public git repository.) If the credentials gets leaked (e.g. by being on a public repo), then we'll have to re-establish them, making life difficult for many people.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  Once you have CLT set up, start making your experiment (see the above wiki for a helpful link, or below for more resources on HTML/Javascript)
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  Once you have your experiment coded, put it up on the Mechanical Turk Sandbox to test it out. The Sandbox has the same functionality as the "live" mTurk, just that you don't have to pay real money. Because there's no money, there are no "real" participants there, so you needn't worry about people taking your HIT on the Sandbox. The Sandbox is mainly for developers to troubleshoot their HITs.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  Get approval from the instructor regarding study design, ethics, power analysis, data analysis plan, etc.
                </li>
              </ol>
