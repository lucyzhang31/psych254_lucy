It also provides a single method, <code>submit(data)</code>, which you use to submit data to Turk. If no submission URL has been provided (because, e.g. you're testing your code outside of the Turk environment), <code>submit</code> displays what would have been submitted (without, obviously, any Turk-specific variables like <code>workerId</code> and <code>assignmentId</code>).  -->

		<h2>Stanford Problem Solving Study</h2>
	</center>
	<p class="block-text">Thank you for your interest in the Stanford problem-solving study. This study examines how your academic and social experiences influence problem-solving. First, you will answer several demographic questions to determine whether you are eligible to participate in the study. If you are eligible to participate in the study, you will automatically progress to the study. During the study, you will be asked to solve several word puzzles and to think about yourself and others who are close to you.  If you are not eligible to participate in the study, you will be exited from the study.

		<h2> Part 1: Word Puzzle Task </h2>
	<p> In this task, you will complete a series of word puzzles commonly referred to as "anagrams." An anagram is a word that is formed by rearranging ALL of the letters of another word. For this task, please complete as many anagrams as you can. You will have 5 minutes to do this task. After 5 minutes, the survey will move on.
  <br>		
<p> If you are not sure of the right answer, please make your best guess and to move on to the next question. </p>
<p> Once you click "Next" to move to a new anagram, you will NOT be able to return to a previous page. </p>

<!-- Include the <a href="experiment.html">JavaScript file for the experiment</a>. As written, that script immediately executes commands, so we include it here at the end of the HTML file to ensure that resources referenced by the script actually exist. For instance, one of the immediately executed commands is <code>showSlide("instructions")</code>. If we loaded experiment.js, say, in the <code>head</code> section, <code>showSlide("instructions")</code> would fail because the <code>instructions</code> slide doesn't exist yet. It is possible to load the script in <code>head</code> but you have to ensure that any immediately executed commands, if they rely on potentially uninitialized HTML elements, are _delayed_ until the page is ready, using either [window.onload][onload] or jQuery's more robust [$(document).ready()][domReady]  -->
